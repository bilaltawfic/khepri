# Phase 2 Completion Status Update

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**PR:** #54

## Goals

Update plan documentation to reflect Phase 2 completion after PR #53 merged the final task (P2-A-05).

## Key Decisions

1. **Mark Phase 2 Complete**: All 16 tasks across 4 workstreams are now finished
2. **Clean up subphase files**: Removed 4 completed subphase plan files that are no longer needed
3. **Update status trackers**: Updated both the main tracker and workstream-specific plans

## Files Changed

- `plans/claude-plan-detailed.md` - Updated Phase 2 status to Complete, marked P2-A-05 with PR #53
- `plans/phase-2/p2-a-onboarding-flow.md` - Updated Workstream A status to 5/5 complete
- Deleted `plans/phase-2/subphases/` directory (4 files for completed tasks)

## Phase 2 Summary

| Workstream | Description | Tasks | PRs |
|------------|-------------|-------|-----|
| A | Onboarding Flow | 5/5 | #33, #36, #48, #39, #53 |
| B | Profile Management | 4/4 | #37, #40, #45, #44 |
| C | Claude Integration | 5/5 | #34, #38, #35, #43, #41 |
