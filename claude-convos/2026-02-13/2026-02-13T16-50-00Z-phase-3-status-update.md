# Phase 3 Plan Status Update

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**PR:** #59

## Goal

Update the project documentation to reflect the completion of the first Phase 3 tasks:
- P3-A-01: MCP Gateway Edge Function Scaffold (PR #55)
- P3-B-01: Intervals.icu Connection Settings UI (PR #56)

## Changes Made

1. **plans/claude-plan-detailed.md**
   - Marked P3-A-01 as complete with PR #55 reference
   - Marked P3-B-01 as complete with PR #56 reference
   - Updated Phase 3 header to show "in progress" status

2. **Removed completed subphase plan**
   - Deleted `plans/phase-3/subphases/p3-a-01-mcp-gateway-scaffold.md` as the task is now complete

## Context

This is a documentation-only update to keep the project plan synchronized with actual progress. Phase 3 Workstreams A (MCP Gateway) and B (Intervals.icu Integration) have both started with their first tasks completed.
