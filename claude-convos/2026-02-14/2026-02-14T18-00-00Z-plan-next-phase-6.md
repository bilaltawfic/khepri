# Session: Plan Next Tasks & Define Phase 6

**Date:** 2026-02-14T18:00:00Z
**Agent(s) Used:** Explore (x2), Plan-next skill

## Goal

Analyze project status, identify parallel tasks, and plan future work after Phase 5.

## Key Decisions

1. **Phase 5 nearly complete** — only P5-B-04 (seed knowledge base) remains
2. **Phase 6 defined** — maps to high-level plan's Phase 4 "Advanced Features", broken into 3 workstreams (A: Calendar, B: Analysis, C: Ad-hoc/History) with 9 tasks
3. **Phase 6 is preliminary** — to be refined before starting; no work will begin until Phase 5 is complete and the plan is discussed
4. **Lesson learned** — don't create new phases without discussing with the user first

## Files Changed

- `plans/claude-plan-detailed.md` — Added Phase 6 section with 3 workstreams, updated dependency graph
- `plans/claude-plan.md` — Added cross-reference to detailed plan Phase 6

## Branches Created

- `feat/p5-b-04-seed-knowledge-base` — Plan for seeding knowledge base (ready to implement)
- `feat/p6-a-01-create-event-mcp-tools` — Plan for calendar MCP tools (parked)
- `feat/p6-c-01-conversation-history-screen` — Plan for conversation history (parked)
- `docs/add-phase-6-plan` — This plan update PR

## Learnings

- Always discuss new phases with the user before creating them
- The detailed plan (Phases 1-5) doesn't map 1:1 to the high-level plan (Phases 1-5) — they diverged as the project evolved
