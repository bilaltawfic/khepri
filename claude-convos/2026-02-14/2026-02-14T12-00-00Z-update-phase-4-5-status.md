# Session: Update Phase 4 & 5 Plan Status

**Date:** 2026-02-14T12:00:00Z
**Duration:** ~5 minutes

## Goal
Update plan documents to reflect completion of Phase 4 and progress in Phase 5, accounting for PRs #79, #80, and #81.

## Key Decisions
- Treated PR #80 (context builder integration) as merged since it was in final review
- Marked Phase 4 as fully complete - all 7 tasks done across both workstreams
- Updated Phase 5 with P5-A-03 completion (embedding generation function)

## Changes Made
- `plans/claude-plan-detailed.md`: Updated phase status summary, marked P4-A-04 (#80), P4-B-03 (#81), P5-A-03 (#79) as complete

## PR Mapping
| PR | Task | Description |
|----|------|-------------|
| #79 | P5-A-03 | Generate-embedding edge function |
| #80 | P4-A-04 | Context builder integration into ai-orchestrator |
| #81 | P4-B-03 | Workout modification safety validation |

## Current Status After Update
- **Phase 4:** Complete (7/7 tasks)
- **Phase 5:** In Progress (3/8 tasks: P5-A-01, P5-A-02, P5-A-03)
- **Remaining Phase 5:** P5-A-04 (semantic search), P5-B-01-04 (knowledge content)
