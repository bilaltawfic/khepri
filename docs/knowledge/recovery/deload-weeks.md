# Deload Weeks

## What Is a Deload Week

A deload week is a planned period of reduced training volume designed to allow the body to absorb accumulated training stress and supercompensate. During a deload, the athlete reduces total training volume while maintaining some workout structure and intensity. The result is reduced fatigue without significant fitness loss, setting the stage for further progression in the next training block.

Deload weeks are not optional extras — they are an essential component of periodized training. Without them, fatigue accumulates faster than the body can recover, leading to stagnation, overtraining, and injury. The adaptation from hard training does not occur during the hard training itself; it occurs during the recovery that follows.

## When to Schedule Deload Weeks

The most common deload patterns for triathlon athletes:

- **Every 3rd week (2:1 pattern).** Two weeks of progressive loading followed by one deload week. Best for athletes over 40, those returning from injury, or athletes new to structured training.
- **Every 4th week (3:1 pattern).** Three weeks of progressive loading followed by one deload week. The most common pattern for age-group triathletes with 1-3 years of structured training.
- **Every 5th week (4:1 pattern).** Four loading weeks before deloading. Suitable only for experienced athletes with strong recovery capacity and low life stress.

The right pattern depends on the individual. Start with 3:1 and adjust based on how the athlete responds. If the athlete consistently feels flat in week 3, switch to 2:1. If they feel strong through week 3 and only fatigue in week 4, stay with 3:1.

## How Much to Reduce Volume

During a deload week, reduce training volume while preserving some structure:

- **Volume reduction:** Decrease total weekly training hours by 40-60%. If a normal week is 10 hours, the deload week should be 4-6 hours.
- **Session frequency:** Maintain the same number of sessions if possible, but make each session shorter. This preserves routine and keeps the athlete engaged.
- **Discipline balance:** Reduce all three sports proportionally. Do not eliminate any discipline entirely during a deload unless recovering from a sport-specific injury.

Example deload week for an athlete who normally trains 10 hours/week:

| Day | Normal Week | Deload Week |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| Monday | 60 min swim | 30 min easy swim (drills) |
| Tuesday | 90 min bike intervals | 45 min easy bike |
| Wednesday | 60 min run tempo | 30 min easy run |
| Thursday | 60 min swim + 30 min strength | 30 min easy swim |
| Friday | Rest | Rest |
| Saturday | 3 hr long bike | 90 min easy bike |
| Sunday | 75 min long run | 40 min easy run |

## Maintaining Intensity During Deloads

A common mistake is making deload weeks entirely easy. While volume drops significantly, including 1-2 short intensity touches helps maintain neuromuscular fitness and prevents the "sluggish" feeling when returning to full training.

Guidelines for deload intensity:

- Include 1-2 sessions with brief efforts at race pace or above (e.g., 4-6 strides during a run, or 4x100m at threshold pace in the pool)
- Keep the intense portions very short: 10-15% of the total session duration
- These should feel refreshing, not fatiguing. If the athlete finishes feeling tired, the intensity portion was too long.
- The remaining 85-90% of training should be genuine zone 1

## Signs You Need an Unplanned Deload

Sometimes the body needs recovery sooner than the schedule dictates. Watch for these signals:

- **Performance plateau or decline** for two or more consecutive sessions despite adequate sleep
- **Persistent heavy legs** that do not resolve after a single rest day
- **Resting heart rate elevated** by 5+ beats for three or more consecutive mornings
- **Mood disruption** — irritability, loss of motivation, or dreading sessions that are normally enjoyable
- **Minor niggles appearing** — shin pain, Achilles tenderness, knee ache — that suggest the body is not recovering between sessions
- **Illness** — even a mild cold indicates the immune system is stressed. Take the deload immediately rather than trying to "push through"

When these signs appear, insert an unplanned deload week immediately. It is better to lose one planned training week than to lose three or more weeks to injury or illness.

## Key Takeaways

- Schedule deload weeks every 3-4 weeks (3:1 pattern for most athletes)
- Reduce volume by 40-60% while maintaining session frequency and routine
- Include 1-2 brief intensity touches to maintain neuromuscular fitness
- Watch for signs of accumulated fatigue and insert unplanned deloads when needed
- Deloads are where adaptation happens — they make you stronger, not weaker
