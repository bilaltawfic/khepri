# Active Recovery

## Active vs Passive Recovery

Active recovery involves performing low-intensity exercise to promote blood flow and facilitate the removal of metabolic waste products from fatigued muscles. Passive recovery means complete rest — no structured exercise. Both have a role in a well-designed training plan.

Active recovery is preferable when:

- The athlete is moderately fatigued but not depleted or injured
- There is a hard session scheduled for the following day and light movement helps reduce stiffness
- The athlete psychologically benefits from maintaining routine and momentum

Passive recovery (complete rest) is preferable when:

- The athlete shows signs of overtraining or accumulated fatigue
- There is an acute injury or illness
- Sleep has been significantly disrupted for multiple nights
- The training plan includes a scheduled full rest day (typically 1 per week)

The key principle: active recovery should help you feel better, not add training stress. If an active recovery session leaves you more tired than before, it was too hard.

## Easy Zone 1 Sessions for Recovery

Effective active recovery sessions share these characteristics:

- **Intensity:** Strictly zone 1 (RPE 2-3 out of 10). This should feel embarrassingly easy. Heart rate should stay below 65% of maximum.
- **Duration:** 20-45 minutes. Longer is not better for recovery sessions.
- **Discipline choice:** Swimming and cycling are better active recovery options than running because they involve less eccentric muscle damage and impact stress.
- **Structure:** Steady, easy effort throughout. No intervals, no tempo segments, no "just a little bit of speed work."

Example active recovery sessions:

- 30 minutes of easy spinning on the bike at low cadence (80-85 RPM)
- 20 minutes of easy swimming with a focus on technique drills
- 30 minutes of easy walking or very light jogging (if running, on soft surfaces)

## When to Take a Complete Rest Day

Every training week should include at least one complete rest day. Additional rest days are warranted when:

- Resting heart rate is elevated by 5+ beats on waking for two or more consecutive mornings
- Muscle soreness persists beyond 48 hours after a familiar workout
- The athlete reports feeling "heavy" or "flat" at the start of multiple sessions
- A hard training block of 3+ weeks has just concluded
- Life stress (work, travel, family) is significantly elevated

Rest does not mean the athlete is "losing fitness." It takes 10-14 days of complete inactivity before measurable fitness loss begins. One or two rest days per week preserve fitness while allowing the body to absorb training adaptations.

## Recovery Modalities

Several recovery modalities can complement active recovery and rest:

- **Foam rolling and self-massage.** 10-15 minutes of foam rolling can reduce perceived muscle soreness and improve short-term range of motion. Focus on major muscle groups: quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, IT band, and thoracic spine.
- **Stretching.** Gentle static stretching after training or in the evening can reduce muscle tension. Avoid aggressive stretching of cold muscles. Hold stretches for 30-60 seconds.
- **Compression garments.** May provide a small benefit for perceived recovery. Wear for 1-3 hours after hard sessions.
- **Cold water immersion.** 10-15 minutes in cold water (10-15°C) can reduce inflammation after very hard sessions. However, chronic use may blunt training adaptations — reserve for competition or exceptionally demanding days.
- **Heat therapy.** Warm baths or saunas can promote blood flow and relaxation. Avoid immediately after hard sessions when inflammation is beneficial for adaptation.

None of these modalities replace sleep and nutrition as the primary recovery tools.

## Post-Workout Recovery Windows

The first 30-60 minutes after training is a window of heightened recovery potential:

- **Hydration.** Replace fluid lost during the session. A simple guideline: drink 500 ml of water for every 0.5 kg of body weight lost during training.
- **Nutrition.** Consume 20-30g of protein and 1-1.2g of carbohydrate per kg of body weight within 30-60 minutes of finishing. A recovery shake, chocolate milk, or a balanced meal all work.
- **Cool-down.** 5-10 minutes of easy movement and light stretching transitions the body from training mode to recovery mode.

## Key Takeaways

- Active recovery should be genuinely easy — zone 1, RPE 2-3, 20-45 minutes
- Swimming and cycling are better active recovery choices than running
- Take at least one complete rest day per week; more during heavy blocks
- Recovery modalities supplement but do not replace sleep and nutrition
- Use the post-workout window for hydration, protein, and carbohydrates
