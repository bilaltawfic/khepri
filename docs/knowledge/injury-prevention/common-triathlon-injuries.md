# Common Triathlon Injuries

## Running Injuries

Running accounts for the majority of triathlon-related injuries due to its high-impact, repetitive nature. The most common running injuries in triathletes:

**Runner's knee (patellofemoral pain syndrome).** Pain around or behind the kneecap, worsening with running, stairs, and prolonged sitting. Caused by muscle imbalances (weak glutes, tight quads), overpronation, or rapid volume increases. Management includes reducing running volume, strengthening hip abductors and quadriceps, and addressing any biomechanical factors.

**IT band syndrome.** Sharp pain on the outer side of the knee, typically appearing at a consistent distance into a run. The iliotibial band becomes irritated where it crosses the lateral femoral condyle. Common in athletes who increase running volume quickly or run on cambered roads. Foam rolling provides temporary relief; long-term resolution requires hip and glute strengthening.

**Shin splints (medial tibial stress syndrome).** Pain along the inner edge of the shinbone during and after running. Caused by training on hard surfaces, worn-out shoes, or rapid volume increases. If not addressed, shin splints can progress to a stress fracture. Reduce running volume, run on softer surfaces, and ensure proper footwear.

**Achilles tendinopathy.** Pain and stiffness in the Achilles tendon, particularly first thing in the morning or at the start of a run. Often caused by calf tightness, rapid increases in hill running, or transitioning to low-drop shoes too quickly. Eccentric calf exercises (heel drops) are the gold-standard treatment.

**Plantar fasciitis.** Pain on the bottom of the heel, worst with the first steps in the morning. Associated with high running volume, tight calves, and unsupportive footwear. Rest, calf stretching, and arch-supporting insoles are first-line treatments.

## Swimming Injuries

Swimming injuries in triathletes are predominantly shoulder-related:

**Swimmer's shoulder.** A catch-all term for shoulder impingement and rotator cuff irritation caused by the repetitive overhead motion of freestyle swimming. Symptoms include pain during the catch and pull phases, or aching after long swim sessions. Contributing factors include poor technique (crossing the midline, thumb-first entry), weak scapular stabilizers, and excessive swim volume without adequate shoulder mobility work.

**Rotator cuff tendinopathy.** Inflammation or degeneration of the rotator cuff tendons, particularly the supraspinatus. Presents as a deep ache in the shoulder that worsens with overhead activity. Prevention focuses on regular rotator cuff strengthening (external rotation exercises) and proper warm-up before swim sessions.

Prevention strategies for swimming injuries:

- Prioritize technique over volume — poor stroke mechanics magnify injury risk with every lap
- Include regular shoulder mobility and rotator cuff strengthening exercises
- Vary strokes during easy swims (backstroke, breaststroke) to reduce repetitive overhead stress
- Use paddles sparingly — they increase shoulder load significantly

## Cycling Injuries

Cycling injuries in triathletes are often related to bike fit and sustained posture:

**Lower back pain.** The most common cycling complaint. Caused by an aggressive aero position, weak core muscles, or poor hip flexibility. Spending hours in a fixed position with a rounded lower back creates chronic strain. Proper bike fit, core strengthening, and regular position changes during long rides are essential.

**Knee pain (anterior).** Pain at the front of the knee during cycling, often related to saddle height (too low), cleat alignment, or high-gear grinding at low cadence. Bike fit adjustments resolve most cases. Aim for a cadence of 85-95 RPM to reduce knee stress.

**Neck and hand numbness.** Prolonged aero position causes neck hyperextension and pressure on the ulnar nerve in the hands. Frequent position changes and properly padded handlebars help. Numbness that persists after riding warrants a bike fit review.

## Risk Factors for Multisport Athletes

Triathlon athletes face unique injury risks compared to single-sport athletes:

- **Cumulative load across three sports** — total training stress can exceed what any single sport would demand
- **Insufficient sport-specific recovery** — a "rest day" from running that includes a hard bike ride is not a rest day for the musculoskeletal system
- **Technique neglect** — athletes may focus training time on their strongest discipline, leading to poor technique and injury risk in weaker disciplines
- **Transition fatigue** — running immediately after cycling (brick workouts) increases injury risk due to altered biomechanics when legs are fatigued

## When to Flag a Concern

The AI coach should recommend the athlete seek professional evaluation when:

- Pain persists for more than 7 days despite reduced training
- Pain increases during a session rather than warming up and improving
- There is visible swelling, bruising, or joint instability
- The athlete reports sharp or stabbing pain (vs. dull ache)
- Numbness or tingling persists after exercise stops
- The athlete is unable to complete normal daily activities without pain

**Important:** The AI coach should never diagnose injuries or prescribe treatment. When injury is suspected, always recommend consulting a sports medicine professional or physiotherapist.

## Key Takeaways

- Running causes the most triathlon injuries — monitor volume increases carefully
- Swimmer's shoulder is preventable with proper technique and rotator cuff strengthening
- Most cycling injuries are bike-fit related — proper fitting prevents the majority of issues
- Track cumulative training load across all three sports, not just individual sport volume
- Recommend professional evaluation when pain persists beyond 7 days or worsens during activity
