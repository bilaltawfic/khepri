# Return to Training After Injury

## Graduated Return-to-Training Protocols

Returning to training after injury requires a structured, progressive approach. Resuming full training too quickly is the most common cause of re-injury. A graduated return protocol ensures the healing tissue is progressively loaded to rebuild tolerance.

General framework for returning to endurance training:

1. **Pain-free daily activities.** Before any training resumes, the athlete should be able to perform normal daily activities (walking, stairs, carrying objects) without pain.
2. **Cross-training phase (1-2 weeks).** Begin with non-impact activity in unaffected disciplines. For a running injury, swim and easy bike. For a shoulder injury, run and bike.
3. **Walk-jog or easy return phase (1-2 weeks).** Introduce the injured-sport discipline at very low volume and intensity. For running, alternate walking and easy jogging. For swimming, use drills and shortened sets.
4. **Progressive loading phase (2-4 weeks).** Gradually increase volume toward pre-injury levels, following the 10% rule. Do not add intensity until volume is at least 70% of pre-injury levels.
5. **Full return phase (1-2 weeks).** Resume normal training structure including intensity sessions. Monitor closely for symptom recurrence.

Total return timeline depends on injury severity: minor issues (1-2 weeks off) may need 3-4 weeks of graduated return, while significant injuries (4+ weeks off) may need 6-8 weeks.

## Pain Scale Guidelines

Athletes should use a consistent pain scale to communicate with the AI coach and guide training decisions:

| Pain Level | Description | Action |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| 0 | No pain | Train normally |
| 1-2 | Mild discomfort, barely noticeable | Continue training, monitor |
| 3-4 | Noticeable pain, does not affect movement | Reduce intensity, shorten session |
| 5-6 | Moderate pain, alters movement pattern | Stop the session, switch to pain-free activity |
| 7+ | Severe pain, unable to continue | Stop immediately, rest, seek professional advice |

Critical rules for pain-guided training:

- **Pain that increases during a session** is a stop signal regardless of the starting level
- **Pain at level 3-4 that does not improve within the first 10 minutes** of a session means stop and try again in 48 hours
- **Morning-after pain** above level 2 following a session indicates the previous session was too much — reduce volume by 30% for the next session
- **Pain that is present at rest** (not just during activity) suggests the injury is not ready for training in that discipline

## Cross-Training Around Injuries

One of triathlon's advantages is built-in cross-training. When one discipline is restricted by injury, the other two can maintain cardiovascular fitness:

**Running injury (most common):**
- Maintain swim and bike training at normal levels (if pain-free)
- Substitute running sessions with aqua jogging or elliptical trainer
- Focus on cycling to maintain aerobic fitness — it has the closest cardiovascular crossover to running
- Use the time to address running-specific weaknesses (hip strength, mobility)

**Swimming injury (typically shoulder):**
- Continue running and cycling normally
- Use kick-only sets or fins to maintain swim-specific fitness without shoulder load
- Focus on rotator cuff rehabilitation exercises
- Gradually reintroduce pull sets as shoulder allows

**Cycling injury (typically lower back or knee):**
- Continue swimming normally
- Running may or may not be affected — test cautiously
- Address bike fit issues before returning to cycling
- Use the time for core strengthening to prevent recurrence

The goal during cross-training is to maintain cardiovascular fitness while the injured area heals. Accept that some discipline-specific fitness will be lost and will need to be rebuilt during the graduated return.

## Communication About Pain and Injury

The AI coach should establish clear communication patterns with athletes about pain and injury:

- **Ask about pain at the start of every session.** A simple check-in ("Any pain or discomfort today?") normalizes the conversation and catches issues early.
- **Take reports seriously.** Never dismiss an athlete's pain report or suggest they "push through" pain above level 2.
- **Track pain trends.** A single episode of level 2 pain is not concerning. Three sessions in a row with level 2 pain in the same area is a warning sign.
- **Celebrate compliance.** Athletes who stop a session due to pain made the right decision. Reinforce this behavior.
- **Document injury history.** Previous injuries increase the risk of recurrence. Factor injury history into training load decisions.

## When to Recommend Professional Medical Advice

The AI coach should recommend the athlete see a healthcare professional when:

- Pain persists for more than 7 days despite rest and modified training
- The injury occurred from a specific traumatic event (fall, collision, sudden onset)
- There are signs of a stress fracture (localized bone pain, pain at rest, pain that worsens with each session)
- Joint instability is reported (knee giving way, ankle rolling easily)
- Neurological symptoms are present (numbness, tingling, weakness)
- The athlete has a history of the same injury recurring

**The AI coach must never attempt to diagnose specific injuries or recommend specific treatments.** Its role is to modify the training plan, flag concerns, and direct athletes to qualified professionals when needed.

## Key Takeaways

- Follow a graduated return protocol: daily activities, cross-training, easy return, progressive loading, full return
- Use the 0-10 pain scale consistently to guide training decisions
- Pain above level 4 or pain that increases during a session means stop immediately
- Leverage triathlon's multi-sport nature to maintain fitness while injured in one discipline
- Always recommend professional evaluation for persistent, worsening, or traumatic injuries
