# Periodization Basics

## What Is Periodization

Periodization is the systematic planning of training into distinct phases, each with specific goals. Rather than training the same way year-round, periodization cycles through phases of varying volume and intensity to maximize fitness gains while managing fatigue and injury risk. For triathlon athletes, periodization coordinates training across three disciplines and aligns peak fitness with target race dates.

The core idea is that the body cannot sustain high training loads indefinitely. By alternating between building phases (high stress) and recovery phases (reduced stress), athletes achieve greater long-term adaptation than with constant moderate training.

## Training Cycle Hierarchy

Periodized training is organized into three nested cycles:

- **Macrocycle** — the full training season or annual plan, typically 6-12 months. Defines the overall progression from base fitness to race-day peak.
- **Mesocycle** — a training block of 3-6 weeks with a specific focus (e.g., aerobic base, threshold development, race-specific intensity). Usually follows a 3:1 or 2:1 load-to-recovery pattern.
- **Microcycle** — a single training week. Defines the day-by-day session plan including hard days, easy days, and rest days.

A typical triathlon season macrocycle contains 4-6 mesocycles progressing from general fitness to race-specific preparation.

## The Four Phases

### Base Phase

Duration: 8-12 weeks. Focus: aerobic endurance and technique. Volume is moderate and increasing. Intensity stays predominantly easy (zone 1-2). This phase builds the cardiovascular and muscular foundation that supports harder training later. Skipping or shortening base phase is the most common mistake among age-group triathletes.

### Build Phase

Duration: 6-8 weeks. Focus: race-specific fitness. Volume plateaus or slightly decreases while intensity increases. Athletes introduce threshold intervals, tempo runs, and race-pace swimming. The build phase develops the ability to sustain effort at or near race intensity.

### Peak Phase

Duration: 2-4 weeks. Focus: sharpening race fitness. Volume drops significantly (30-40% below build phase) while a small number of high-quality, race-intensity sessions remain. The goal is to absorb accumulated fitness while shedding fatigue.

### Taper Phase

Duration: 1-3 weeks (longer for Ironman, shorter for sprint). Focus: full recovery before race day. Volume drops to 40-60% of peak training. Intensity stays moderate with a few short, sharp efforts to maintain neuromuscular readiness. The taper allows the body to supercompensate, arriving at race day fresh and fast.

## Periodization Models for Triathlon

**Linear periodization** progresses steadily from high volume and low intensity to lower volume and higher intensity. Best for athletes with one or two key races per year.

**Block periodization** concentrates one fitness quality per mesocycle (e.g., 3 weeks of threshold focus, then 3 weeks of VO2max). Effective for experienced athletes who need targeted improvement.

**Undulating periodization** varies intensity within each microcycle (e.g., Monday hard, Wednesday easy, Friday moderate). Can be combined with a linear macrocycle. Works well for athletes who race frequently throughout the season.

For most age-group triathletes, a linear macrocycle with undulating microcycles provides the best balance of structure and flexibility.

## When to Adjust the Plan

No periodization plan survives contact with real life unchanged. Adjust when:

- Illness or injury interrupts training for more than 5 days — extend the current phase rather than skipping ahead
- Consistent signs of overtraining appear — insert an unplanned recovery week
- An athlete is adapting faster than expected — cautiously shorten the base phase
- Life stress (work, family) is unusually high — reduce volume by 20-30% and maintain the phase focus

The plan serves the athlete, not the other way around. Rigidly following a periodization schedule when the body signals otherwise leads to injury and burnout.

## Key Takeaways

- Periodization cycles through base, build, peak, and taper phases to align peak fitness with race day
- Training is organized into macrocycles (season), mesocycles (3-6 week blocks), and microcycles (weekly)
- Base phase is the foundation — never skip it
- Most age-group triathletes benefit from linear periodization with undulating weekly structure
- Adjust the plan based on athlete response rather than following it rigidly
