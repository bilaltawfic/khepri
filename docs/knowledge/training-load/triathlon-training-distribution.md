# Triathlon Training Distribution

## The Polarized Training Model

The polarized training model (also called 80/20) is the most evidence-supported intensity distribution for endurance athletes. Approximately 80% of training time should be at low intensity (zone 1-2, conversational pace) and 20% at moderate-to-high intensity (zone 3 and above). This distribution has been observed in elite endurance athletes across multiple sports.

Common mistakes with intensity distribution:

- **Too much moderate intensity.** Many age-group athletes train in zone 3 (tempo/threshold) too often, accumulating fatigue without the specific benefits of either easy or hard training.
- **Not easy enough on easy days.** Easy sessions should feel genuinely easy. If you cannot hold a conversation, you are going too hard.
- **Not hard enough on hard days.** When intensity sessions are scheduled, commit to the prescribed effort. Half-hearted intervals provide less benefit than a properly executed easy session.

The 80/20 split applies to total weekly training time across all three disciplines, not to each discipline independently.

## Splitting Time Between Swim, Bike, and Run

The distribution of training time across disciplines depends on race distance, athlete strengths and weaknesses, and time available. General guidelines:

| Race Distance | Swim | Bike | Run |
|---------------|------|------|-----|
| Sprint | 25-30% | 35-40% | 30-35% |
| Olympic | 20-25% | 40-45% | 30-35% |
| Half-Ironman | 15-20% | 45-50% | 30-35% |
| Ironman | 10-15% | 50-55% | 30-35% |

Key principles:

- **Bike receives the most training time** because it is the longest leg in every race distance and has the highest potential for time improvement.
- **Run proportion stays relatively stable** because run fitness drops quickly with reduced volume and running carries the highest injury risk.
- **Swim proportion decreases as race distance increases** because the swim leg becomes a smaller percentage of total race time at longer distances.
- **Adjust for weaknesses.** An athlete who is a strong cyclist but weak swimmer should shift 5-10% more time to swimming during the base phase.

## Brick Workouts

Brick workouts combine two disciplines back-to-back, most commonly bike-to-run. They train the body to perform under the specific fatigue of transitioning between sports.

Guidelines for brick sessions:

- **Frequency:** One brick workout per week during the build and peak phases is sufficient. During base phase, every 2-3 weeks.
- **Structure:** Complete the bike portion first, then transition immediately to running. The run segment should be 15-30 minutes, not a full long run.
- **Intensity:** Keep the initial run segment at easy pace for the first 5-10 minutes. The legs will feel heavy — this is normal and improves with practice.
- **Progression:** Start with shorter bricks (45 min bike + 15 min run) and build toward race-simulation bricks as the target race approaches.

Swim-to-bike bricks are less common but valuable for open-water race preparation. Practice the full transition including wetsuit removal if applicable.

## Training Volume by Race Distance

Approximate weekly training hours for age-group triathletes at different experience levels:

| Race Distance | Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced |
|---------------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Sprint | 4-6 hrs | 6-8 hrs | 8-10 hrs |
| Olympic | 6-8 hrs | 8-10 hrs | 10-14 hrs |
| Half-Ironman | 8-10 hrs | 10-14 hrs | 14-18 hrs |
| Ironman | 10-14 hrs | 14-18 hrs | 18-25 hrs |

These are general ranges. Individual capacity varies based on training history, age, recovery ability, and life stress. It is better to consistently complete 8 quality hours than to attempt 12 hours and accumulate fatigue and missed sessions.

## Balancing Three Sports

Managing three sports simultaneously requires discipline to avoid overuse:

- **Limit high-impact volume.** Running is the highest-injury-risk discipline. Never increase running volume in the same week you add a new intensity session.
- **Use cycling as active recovery.** Easy spinning (zone 1) promotes blood flow without the eccentric muscle damage of running.
- **Schedule swim early in the week.** Swimming is the least fatiguing sport and provides an upper-body counterbalance to the leg-dominant bike and run.
- **Monitor total load, not just individual sport volume.** A hard bike interval session followed by a hard run the next day is two hard days in a row regardless of the sport switch.

## Key Takeaways

- Follow the 80/20 polarized model: 80% easy, 20% moderate-to-hard across all three disciplines
- Bike training receives the most time; run stays consistent; swim decreases with longer race distances
- Include one brick workout per week during build phase
- Match total weekly volume to race distance and experience level
- Track combined training load across all three sports to prevent overuse
